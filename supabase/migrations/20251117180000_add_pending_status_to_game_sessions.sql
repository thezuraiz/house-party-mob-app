/*
  # Add Pending Status to Game Sessions

  ## Changes
  - Adds 'pending' status to game_sessions status constraint
  - Ensures 'cancelled' status is included
  - This allows games to be in pending state while waiting for player acceptance
  - Cancelled games can be filtered out from queries

  ## Valid Statuses
  - pending: Waiting for all players to accept invitations
  - active: Game is currently being played (scores being entered)
  - ongoing: Multi-day game that's in progress
  - completed: Game finished with final scores
  - cancelled: Game was deleted/cancelled by admin
