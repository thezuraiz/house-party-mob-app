/*
  # Fix add_free_kits_to_new_user Function to Bypass RLS

  1. Changes
    - Update add_free_kits_to_new_user function to properly bypass RLS
    - Set search_path for security
    - This allows the trigger to insert into user_house_kits during signup
    
  2. Security
    - Function runs as SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS
    - Only inserts free common kits (price_cents = 0)
    - Automatically called by trigger, not directly accessible to users
*/

-- Recreate the function with proper RLS bypass
