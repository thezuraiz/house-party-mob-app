/*
  # Fix Search Users to Exclude Blocked Users

  1. Changes
    - Update search_users_by_username to exclude blocked users (both directions)
    - Users who have blocked the current user won't appear in search
    - Users that the current user has blocked won't appear in search
    - When unblocking, users can search and send friend requests again

  2. Security
    - Maintains existing RLS and authentication checks
    - Properly handles both directions of blocking
