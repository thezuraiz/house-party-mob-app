/*
  # Fix Trigger Execution Order for User Signup

  1. Changes
    - Recreate triggers with explicit ordering to ensure profile is created first
    - handle_new_user runs first (creates profile)
    - add_free_kits_to_new_user runs second (adds kits, which may need profile)
    
  2. Security
    - Both triggers run with SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS
    - Maintains existing security model
