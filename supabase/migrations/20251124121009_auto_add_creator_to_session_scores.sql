  # Auto-Add Creator to Session Scores

  ## Summary
  Ensures the game creator always has a session_scores entry when a game session is created.
  This prevents issues where the creator isn't included in leaderboards if they forget to
  manually select themselves in the UI.

  ## Changes
  1. **Create Trigger Function**
     - Automatically inserts a session_scores row for the creator (created_by user)
     - Runs when a new game_session is created
     - Uses ON CONFLICT to prevent duplicate entries
     - Acts as a safety net for the frontend auto-selection

  2. **Benefits**
     - Creator always appears in game history and leaderboards
     - Fixes "only seeing friends" bug
     - Works even if frontend selection logic has issues
     - No manual intervention required
