/*
  # Fix House Members RLS Without Recursion

  ## Problem
  - Any policy on house_members that references house_members creates infinite recursion
  - The houses table SELECT policy depends on house_members, creating circular dependency
  
  ## Solution
  - Create a permissive policy that allows authenticated users to view all house_members
  - This is safe because house_members only contains membership info (no sensitive data)
  - Users still can't see houses they're not members of due to houses RLS policy

  ## Security
  - Authenticated users can view house membership records
  - Actual house visibility is still controlled by houses table RLS
  - No sensitive data exposed in house_members table

-- Create a simple, non-recursive policy
-- Safe because house_members doesn't contain sensitive data
-- The houses table RLS controls what houses users can actually see
