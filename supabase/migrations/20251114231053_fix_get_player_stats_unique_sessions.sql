/*
  # Fix get_player_stats Function to Count Unique Sessions

  1. Changes
    - Update get_player_stats function to count unique game sessions instead of score entries
    - Prevent double-counting when players have multiple score entries per session
    - Ensure accurate win counting based on unique sessions won

  2. Performance
    - Use COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) for accurate session counting
    - Maintains same security and access patterns
