  # Fix Leaderboard Function - Player Streaks Issue

  1. Problem
    - Leaderboard function references `player_streaks` table which doesn't exist
    - This causes leaderboard to fail with "relation player_streaks does not exist"

  2. Solution
    - Create `player_streaks` table if it doesn't exist
    - Add proper indexes and RLS policies
    - This allows leaderboard to display streak data

  3. Tables Created
    - `player_streaks` - Tracks win/loss streaks per player per house
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to profiles)
      - `house_id` (uuid, foreign key to houses)
      - `streak_type` (text: 'win' or 'loss')
      - `current_streak` (integer)
      - `best_streak` (integer)
      - `last_updated` (timestamptz)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)

  4. Security
    - Enable RLS
    - Users can read their own streaks
    - Users can read streaks of house members
