  # Fix Friend Request Race Conditions

  ## Root Cause
  - When User A cancels and resends a friend request, User B's UI may still reference the old (deleted) request ID
  - The accept_friend_request function fails with "item not found" when trying to accept the deleted request
  - No unique constraint prevents multiple pending requests between same users
  - Race condition between delete and create operations

  ## Solution
  1. Add partial unique constraint for pending requests only
  2. Update accept_friend_request to lookup by relationship instead of just ID
  3. Add proper error handling and request resolution logic
  4. Clean up stale data that could cause issues

  ## Security
  - Maintains all existing RLS policies
  - Uses SECURITY DEFINER with proper auth checks

-- Step 1: Clean up any existing duplicate pending requests
-- Keep only the most recent pending request between each pair of users
DELETE FROM friend_requests fr1
WHERE fr1.status = 'pending'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM friend_requests fr2
    WHERE fr2.sender_id = fr1.sender_id
      AND fr2.recipient_id = fr1.recipient_id
      AND fr2.status = 'pending'
      AND fr2.created_at > fr1.created_at
  );

-- Step 2: Add partial unique constraint for pending requests only
-- This prevents duplicate pending requests while allowing multiple rejected/accepted records
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS unique_pending_friend_request
  ON friend_requests(sender_id, recipient_id)
  WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Step 3: Create improved accept function that handles the race condition
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION accept_friend_request(request_id uuid)

-- Step 4: Improve the friend request search to use the most recent pending request
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_pending_request_by_users(sender_user_id uuid, recipient_user_id uuid)

-- Step 5: Add trigger to notify realtime subscribers when requests are deleted
-- This helps keep the UI in sync
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_friend_request_delete()

-- Step 6: Add helpful comments
COMMENT ON FUNCTION accept_friend_request IS 'Accepts a friend request with race condition handling - will find the current pending request even if the original ID is stale';
COMMENT ON INDEX unique_pending_friend_request IS 'Ensures only one pending friend request can exist between any two users';
