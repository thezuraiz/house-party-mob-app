/*
  # Fix Decline Invitation to Remove Session Scores
  
  ## Summary
  Updates the decline_game_invitation function to also remove any session_scores
  entries that were created when the invitation was initially accepted. This ensures
  clean state when a user changes their mind.
  
  ## Changes
  - Update decline_game_invitation to delete session_scores for the declined invitation
  - Ensures no orphaned session scores remain after declining
  
  ## Security
  - Function uses SECURITY DEFINER with proper auth checks
  - Only removes scores for the declining user
