/*
  # Add soft delete support to games table

  1. Changes
    - Add `deleted_at` timestamp column for soft deletes
    - Games with a non-null `deleted_at` are considered deleted
    - This allows for game recovery and maintains data integrity
  
  2. Notes
    - Soft deletes are preferred over hard deletes to maintain historical data
    - Queries should filter with `.is('deleted_at', null)` to exclude deleted games
