/*
  # Protect House Creator from Ever Being Changed

  1. Security Measures
    - Add CHECK constraint to prevent creator_id updates at database level
    - Add trigger to block any attempts to modify creator_id
    - Ensure creator_id is set once on creation and NEVER changed
  
  2. Why This Matters
    - House creator determines who the "House Master" is
    - This should NEVER change regardless of who joins or leaves
    - Multiple layers of protection ensure data integrity
