/*
  # Create house_customizations table

  1. New Tables
    - `house_customizations`
      - `house_id` (uuid, primary key, references houses table)
      - `applied_by` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `theme_data` (jsonb, stores kit theme information)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz, default now())
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz, default now())
  
  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `house_customizations` table
    - Add policies for house admins to read and manage customizations
    - Add policies for house members to read customizations
  
  3. Purpose
    - Stores applied kit themes for each house
    - Allows tracking who applied the theme and when
    - Supports upsert operations for updating house themes
