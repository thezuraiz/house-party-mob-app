  # Fix Session Scores and Profiles Relationship

  1. Changes
    - Add foreign key constraint from session_scores.user_id to profiles.id
    - This allows Supabase to join session_scores with profiles table in queries
    - The relationship is needed for leaderboard queries to fetch usernames

  2. Important Notes
    - Uses IF NOT EXISTS to prevent errors if constraint already exists
    - ON DELETE CASCADE ensures orphaned scores are cleaned up if a profile is deleted
