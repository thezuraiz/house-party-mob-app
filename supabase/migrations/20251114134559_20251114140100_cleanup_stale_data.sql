-- Clean up one-way friendships (should be bidirectional)
DELETE FROM friendships f1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM friendships f2
  WHERE f2.user_id = f1.friend_id
    AND f2.friend_id = f1.user_id

-- Clean up rejected friend requests older than 1 day
-- This allows users to send fresh requests after rejection
DELETE FROM friend_requests
WHERE status = 'rejected'
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';

-- Note: pending requests are kept until they're acted upon
