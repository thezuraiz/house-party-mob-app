  # Fix House Kits RLS to Allow User-Owned Kits

  1. Changes
    - Update house_kits RLS policy to allow users to view kits they own
    - Current policy only allows viewing "is_active = true" kits
    - Users should see all kits they've unlocked in their collection

  2. Security
    - Users can view kits they own through user_house_kits table
    - Maintains security by requiring ownership verification
