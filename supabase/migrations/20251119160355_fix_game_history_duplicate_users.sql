/*
  # Fix Game History Duplicate Users

  ## Problem
  The get_house_game_history function was returning duplicate user entries
  when aggregating session scores.

  ## Solution
  Drop and recreate function to ensure each user appears only once per session
  by using a subquery with DISTINCT ON.

  ## Changes
  - Drop existing get_house_game_history function
  - Recreate with proper deduplication logic
