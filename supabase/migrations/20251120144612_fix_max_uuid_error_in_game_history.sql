  # Fix MAX(uuid) Error in get_house_game_history Function

  ## Problem
  The current get_house_game_history function uses MAX() on UUID columns:
  - MAX(CASE WHEN ds.is_winner THEN ds.user_id END)
  
  PostgreSQL doesn't support MAX() aggregate on UUID types, causing:
  "function max(uuid) does not exist"

  ## Solution
  Replace the aggregation approach with DISTINCT ON to get the winner info,
  similar to how the optimized version was supposed to work.

  ## Changes
  - Remove MAX() calls on UUID columns
  - Use a separate CTE with DISTINCT ON for winners
  - Ensure the function returns proper winner information
