/*
  # Fix House Members Realtime Updates

  1. Changes
    - Ensure house_members table has realtime enabled
    - Ensure houses table has realtime enabled
    - Add trigger to refresh house list when member leaves
    - Add better cascade behavior for member deletions
  
  2. Impact
    - Houses will disappear from UI immediately when user leaves
    - Realtime subscriptions will properly update the UI
    - No more stale house data after leaving
