/*
  # Backfill missing creator_id values in houses table

  1. Problem
    - Houses created before the creator_id column was added to the INSERT statement have NULL creator_id
    - This causes the apply-kit screen to show zero houses even though users created/own houses

  2. Solution
    - Find houses where creator_id IS NULL
    - Look up an admin member for each house (they are most likely the creator)
    - Set that admin as the creator_id

  3. Safety
    - Only updates houses where creator_id IS NULL
    - Only sets creator_id if there is an admin member for the house
