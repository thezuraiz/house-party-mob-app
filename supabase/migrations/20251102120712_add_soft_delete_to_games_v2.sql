/*
  # Add Soft Delete Functionality to Games
  
  ## Changes
  
  1. Add `deleted_at` column to games table
    - `deleted_at` (timestamptz, nullable) - When the game was soft deleted
  
  2. Add `deleted_by` column to games table
    - `deleted_by` (uuid, nullable) - Which user deleted the game
  
  ## Purpose
  
  This migration enables users to delete games from their house without losing
  historical game session data. Deleted games will:
  - Still preserve all game_sessions records
  - Not appear in active game lists
  - Maintain referential integrity
  
  ## Notes
  
  - Existing games will have NULL deleted_at (not deleted)
  - Queries should filter WHERE deleted_at IS NULL to show only active games
  - Game sessions will remain accessible even when parent game is soft deleted
