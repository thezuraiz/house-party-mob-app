  # Fix Accept Game Invitation - Create Score Entry
  
  ## Summary
  Fixes critical bug where invited players don't get score entries created when
  they accept game invitations. This causes them to not appear in game history.
  
  ## Problem
  When a player accepts a game invitation, the function only:
  - Adds them to the house (if needed)
  - Marks invitation as accepted
  But it does NOT create a session_scores entry, so the player never appears
  in the game results even though they accepted and played.
  
  ## Solution
  After accepting the invitation, create a session_scores entry for the player
  with initial score of 0. The score will be updated during gameplay.
  
  ## Changes
  - Add INSERT into session_scores after accepting invitation
  - Create entry for both existing house members and newly joined members
