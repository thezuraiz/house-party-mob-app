  ## Purpose
  Retrieves complete game history for a house including:
  - All completed game sessions
  - Game metadata (name, type, emoji)
  - All participant scores (even if current user didn't play)
  - Winner information
  - Session timestamps

  ## Returns
  - session_id: Unique session identifier
  - game_id: Game identifier
  - game_name: Name of the game
  - game_emoji: Game icon emoji
  - game_type: Type/category of game
  - completed_at: When the session ended
  - participants: JSON array of all players with scores
  - winner_id: User ID of the winner
  - winner_name: Display name of winner

  ## Security
  - SECURITY DEFINER to bypass RLS
  - Only returns data for houses the user is a member of
