  # Fix House Permissions and Invite Code System

  ## Summary
  Implements hierarchical permission system for houses with proper admin/member distinctions
  and fixes the invite code lookup issue that prevents users from joining houses.

  ## Changes

  ### 1. Houses Table
  - Add `is_private` column (default true) for private/public house distinction
  - Update RLS policies to allow invite code lookup for non-members

  ### 2. RLS Policy Updates

  #### Houses Table:
  - **NEW**: Allow authenticated users to view houses by invite_code (for join flow)
  - **UPDATED**: Restrict UPDATE to admins and creators only (not regular members)
  - **KEEP**: Existing DELETE policy (creators and admins only)
  - **KEEP**: Existing member view policy

  #### Games Table:
  - **KEEP**: Only admins can create/update/delete games (already correct)
  - **ADD**: Explicit DELETE policy for admins only

  #### Game Sessions Table:
  - **KEEP**: All house members can create game sessions (correct - allows members to start games)
  - **UPDATED**: Only session creator or admins can update sessions (not all members)

  ### 3. Security Notes
  - Private houses (is_private = true) can only be joined via invite code or game invitation
  - Regular members cannot modify house structure (settings, games)
  - Regular members CAN start game sessions using existing games
  - All policies check 50-member house limit via application logic
