  # Fix Session Scores INSERT Policy

  1. Problem
    - Session creators cannot insert scores for players in their games
    - The existing WITH CHECK policy might not properly reference the session_id being inserted
    - This causes RLS violation when starting a game

  2. Solution
    - Drop and recreate INSERT policy with clearer logic
    - Use NEW.session_id reference pattern that works during INSERT
    - Allow session creator to insert scores for any player in their session

  3. Security
    - Only the session creator can insert scores
    - Maintains data integrity by checking game_sessions.created_by

-- Note: In WITH CHECK during INSERT, bare column names (without table prefix) reference the NEW values
