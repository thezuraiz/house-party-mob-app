  # Fix Game History Missing Data - Backfill completed_at

  ## Problem
  Game sessions were being updated with `ended_at` but not `completed_at`.
  The `get_house_game_history` function relies on `completed_at` to:
  1. Filter completed games
  2. Order games by completion time

  This caused completed games to not appear in the game history.

  ## Solution
  1. Backfill `completed_at` for all completed game sessions that have `ended_at` but null `completed_at`
  2. For sessions marked as completed but missing both timestamps, set them to the session's created_at
  3. Ensure future games set both timestamps (handled in application code)

  ## Changes
  - Update existing completed sessions to have completed_at = ended_at where completed_at is null
  - Update sessions with status='completed' but no timestamps to use created_at as fallback
