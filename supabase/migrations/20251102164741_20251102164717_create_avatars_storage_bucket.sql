-- Create Avatars Storage Bucket
--
-- 1. Storage Setup
--    - Create public avatars bucket for profile photos
--    - Enable public access for viewing avatars
--    
-- 2. Security Policies
--    - Users can upload/update their own avatar (path: user_id/*)
--    - Users can delete their own avatar
--    - Anyone can view avatars (public bucket)
--    
-- 3. Configuration
--    - Max file size: 5MB (enforced in app layer)
--    - Allowed types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp

-- Create the avatars bucket if it doesn't exist
