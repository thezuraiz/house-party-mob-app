/*
  # Fix Private Profile Security

  1. Changes
    - Add RLS policy to protect private profiles from unauthorized access
    - Ensure user_profile_settings can only be viewed by:
      - The profile owner themselves
      - Friends of non-private profiles
      - Public profiles (is_private = false)

  2. Security
    - Prevents unauthorized access to private profile settings
    - Maintains data privacy for users who mark profiles as private
