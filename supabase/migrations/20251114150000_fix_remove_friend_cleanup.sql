/*
  # Fix Friend Removal to Delete Accepted Requests

  1. Problem
    - When users remove friends, the accepted friend request remains in the database
    - This causes "already exists" error when trying to re-add the same user
    - The unique constraint on friend_requests prevents duplicate requests

  2. Solution
    - Update remove_friendship() to also delete accepted friend requests
    - Update block_user() to handle all friend request statuses
    - This allows users to re-add friends after removal

  3. Security
    - Maintains existing RLS policies
    - Only affects friend_requests with accepted/rejected status
