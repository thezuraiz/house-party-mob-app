  # Fix Game Sessions RLS for Invitations
  
  ## Summary
  Allows users to view game sessions they've been invited to, even if they're not
  yet members of the house. This fixes the issue where invited users can't see
  their invitations because the game_sessions join returns null.
  
  ## Changes
  - Add new RLS policy allowing users to view game sessions they're invited to
  
  ## Security
  - Only grants SELECT access for sessions with pending invitations
  - Does not allow INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
  - User must have a pending invitation to that specific session
