  # Fix Friend Stats Visibility
  
  1. Problem
    - Users cannot view their friends' game stats
    - RLS policies only allow viewing own scores or scores in shared houses
  
  2. Solution
    - Add policy to allow viewing session scores of friends
    - This enables the player-stats page to work correctly when viewing friends
  
  3. Security
    - Only works for confirmed friendships (both users accepted)
    - Maintains privacy for non-friends
