/*
  # Fix game_invitations Nested Query Permissions

  ## Summary
  Fixes 400 errors when querying game_invitations with nested joins to
  game_sessions, games, houses, and profiles tables.

  ## Changes
  1. Grant SELECT permissions on related tables for nested queries
  2. Update RLS policies to allow authenticated users to view related data
  3. Add missing indexes for performance

  ## Security
  - Maintains data privacy by only exposing data visible through invitations
  - Users can only see data related to their own invitations
