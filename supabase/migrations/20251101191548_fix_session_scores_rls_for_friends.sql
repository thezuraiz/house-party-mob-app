/*
  # Fix Session Scores RLS for Friend Games
  
  1. Changes
    - Update INSERT policy to allow game creators to create scores for all players
    - Game creator (who creates the session) can insert scores for any player in that session
  
  2. Security
    - Only the session creator can insert scores
    - Players can still only view their own scores or scores in their houses
