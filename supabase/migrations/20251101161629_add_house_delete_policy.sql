  1. Security Changes
    - Add DELETE policy allowing house creators and admins to delete houses
    - Policy checks:
      - User is the creator (creator_id = auth.uid()), OR
      - User is an admin of the house
  
  2. Purpose
    - Enables house creators and admins to delete houses
    - Maintains security by restricting deletion to authorized users only
