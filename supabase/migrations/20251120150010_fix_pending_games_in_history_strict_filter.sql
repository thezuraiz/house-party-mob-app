  # Fix Pending Games Appearing in History
  
  ## Problem
  Games with status='pending' are appearing in game history because:
  1. When players accept invitations, session_scores entries are created with score=0
  2. The get_house_game_history function checks if scores exist, which they do
  3. But these are placeholder scores for pending games, not actual gameplay results
  
  ## Solution
  Add stricter filtering to ONLY show games where:
  1. Status = 'completed' (already checked)
  2. completed_at IS NOT NULL (already checked)
  3. At least one player has placement assigned (NEW CHECK)
     - Placement is only set when the game finishes and winners are determined
     - Pending games have NULL placement for all players
  
  ## Changes
  - Update get_house_game_history to require at least one player with non-null placement
