/*
  # Fix user_equipped_kits Foreign Key with Data Cleanup
  
  1. Changes
    - Delete any equipped kit records that reference non-existent house_kits
    - Drop the old foreign key constraint pointing to user_kit_catalog
    - Add new foreign key constraint pointing to house_kits
  
  2. Security
    - Maintains all existing RLS policies
    - Cleans up invalid data before adding constraint
