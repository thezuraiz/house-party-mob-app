/*
  # Add Automatic Winner and Placement Calculation

  ## Changes
  1. Create trigger function to automatically calculate winners and placements
  2. Runs whenever session_scores are updated
  3. Calculates based on game's scoring rules (higher/lower is better)
  4. Updates is_winner and placement fields automatically

  ## Impact
  - Winners will always be correctly identified
  - Placements will always be calculated
  - Win rates will calculate correctly
  - No manual intervention needed
