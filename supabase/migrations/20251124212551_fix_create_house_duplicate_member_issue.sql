  # Fix Create House Duplicate Member Issue

  1. Problem
    - When invite code collision occurs, house is created but member insert fails
    - On retry, user is already a member causing duplicate key error
    - This leaves orphaned houses in the database

  2. Solution
    - Use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for house_members
    - Check if house was actually created before returning
    - Prevent duplicate member entries gracefully

  3. Security
    - Maintains existing RLS and permissions
