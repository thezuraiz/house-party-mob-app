/*
  # Fix House Members Self-Delete Policy

  ## Problem
  Users cannot leave houses because the DELETE policy only allows admins to remove members.
  Regular members need to be able to remove themselves (leave the house).

  ## Changes
  1. Drop the existing restrictive DELETE policy
  2. Create a new DELETE policy that allows:
     - Admins to remove any member from their house
     - Any member to remove themselves (leave the house)

  ## Security
  - Users can only delete their own membership record
  - Admins can delete any member from houses they admin
