/*
  # Add Max Attempts for Accuracy Games

  1. Changes
    - Add max_attempts column to games table for accuracy-based scoring
    - This stores the fixed number of attempts set during game creation
    - Players will then increment hits with a + button during the game
    
  2. Notes
    - Only used for accuracy scoring type
    - Allows for cleaner UX where attempts are pre-set
