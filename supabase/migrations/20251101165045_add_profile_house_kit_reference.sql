/*
  # Add House Kit Reference to User Profiles

  1. Changes
    - Add `equipped_house_kit_id` column to `user_profile_settings` table
    - This allows users to equip a house kit to their profile for visual customization
    - The kit will be used to style their profile header, stats cards, and player card
  
  2. Security
    - Foreign key constraint ensures only valid house kits can be equipped
    - Users can equip any house kit (they don't need to own it first)
