/*
  # Fix All Recursive house_members RLS Policies

  ## Problem
  Multiple policies on house_members contain recursive subqueries that cause infinite loops:
  - "Admins can update house members" 
  - "Admins can delete house members"
  - "Members can leave house or admins can remove members"
  
  All check admin status by querying house_members again, causing infinite recursion.

  ## Solution
  Replace these policies with simpler, non-recursive versions:
  - For updates: Only allow users to update their own nickname/emoji pack
  - For deletes: Allow users to delete their own memberships only
  - Admin operations will be handled via SECURITY DEFINER functions

  ## Changes
  1. Drop all recursive policies
  2. Create simple, non-recursive policies
  3. Admin operations (removing members, updating roles) handled by backend functions
